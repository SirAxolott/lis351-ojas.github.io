                <h2>Camp Half-Blood</h2>
                <h3>Sanctuary of the Greek Demigods</h3>
                <p>Camp Half-Blood is the sanctuary for Greek demigods, hidden behind magical borders on Long Island. It serves as a training ground, home, and school for children of the gods. Life at the camp balances mundane summer activities — archery, cabin duty, and lessons — with mythic training: combat with celestial bronze, practice quests, and lessons in mythology and survival.</p>
                <div class="camp-details">
                    <h4>Key Features:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Cabins:</strong> Each god has a cabin; some cabins are larger depending on the number of children (e.g., Zeus's cabin is large and prestigious).</li>
                        <li><strong>Training Areas:</strong> The arena and woods provide realistic training for quests; classrooms teach history, Latin (for some), and tactics.</li>
                        <li><strong>Beach & Shrine:</strong> The beach is sacred to Poseidon's children and often used for rites and healing.</li>

                <h2>Camp Jupiter</h2>
                <h3>Legion of the Roman Demigods</h3>
                <p>Camp Jupiter is the Roman counterpart located on the west coast. Built like a fortified city, it values discipline, duty, and structure; recruits train as legionaries rather than the more free-form Greek heroes. Where Camp Half-Blood emphasizes individual quests and heroism, Camp Jupiter emphasizes group cohesion, ranks, and strategic warfare.</p>
                <div class="camp-details">
                    <h4>Key Features:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Legion Structure:</strong> Cohorts and centuries replace cabins; rank and duty shape a recruit's role.</li>
                        <li><strong>Rituals:</strong> Oaths, banners, and public ceremonies reinforce unity and purpose.</li>
                        <li><strong>New Rome:</strong> A functioning city that reflects Roman governance and public life.</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Daily Life & Training</h2>
            <p>Whether Greek or Roman, life at the camps is a mix of ordinary teenage life and mythic preparation. Meals, chores, and friendships happen alongside combat practice, map-reading, and prophecy lessons. Counselors teach tactics, mentors provide quest advice, and the Oracle or seers may issue cryptic prophecies.</p>
            <p>Training emphasizes adaptability: learning to fight with different weapons, understanding the Mist (how mortals see the world differently), and mastering the ethics of leadership. Many pivotal character moments in the books happen during quiet, ordinary moments at camp — not just on quests.</p>
