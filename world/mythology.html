            <h2>Key Mythological Terms</h2>
            <p>Before diving into the specifics, here are some essential terms you'll encounter throughout the Percy Jackson series:</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Demigod</dt>
                <dd>A half-human, half-god hero who inherits special powers from their divine parent. Also known as a "half-blood" in the series.</dd>
                
                <dt>The Mist</dt>
                <dd>A supernatural veil that prevents mortals from seeing monsters, gods, and magical events, making them perceive something more mundane instead.</dd>
                
                <dt>Celestial Bronze</dt>
                <dd>A magical metal that can harm monsters and immortals but passes harmlessly through mortals. The primary material for demigod weapons.</dd>

            </dl>

        <section class="mythology-section monsters">
            <h2>Monsters</h2>
            <p>Monsters are the ever-present threat in the Percy Jackson universe — ancient creatures of myth that reappear in the modern world. From the cunning Sphinx to the terrifying chimera, these beings test demigods both physically and morally. Monsters often symbolise challenges the heroes must overcome: pride, temptation, and loss.</p>
            <p>Common foes include harpies and cyclopes, but the series also brings back legendary figures such as Medusa and the Minotaur with modern twists. Many monsters are not merely obstacles; they carry pieces of ancient lore and can offer clues about the past, prophecies, or locations of magical artifacts.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Minotaur</strong> — A recurring early adversary in the series and a classic labyrinth-dwelling foe.</li>
                <li><strong>Hydra</strong> — Multiple-headed beasts whose regrowth forces demigods to think strategically.</li>
                <li><strong>Empousai & Harpies</strong> — Shape-shifting and flighted enemies used to sow chaos and steal food or knowledge.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mythology-section artifacts">
            <h2>Magical Items & Artifacts</h2>
            <p>The world is full of relics that blend myth and modern utility. Weapons like Riptide (Percy's sword) and magical objects such as the Helm of Darkness or the Master Bolt are central to the plot. These items often come with rules and curses, and their true power usually requires understanding their origin story.</p>
            <p>Artifacts serve several narrative purposes: they provide tools for quests, they act as MacGuffins that drive the plot, and they reveal character through how heroes choose to use them. Some items are fragments of divine will, others are forged by legendary smiths like Hephaestus.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Riptide (Anaklusmos)</strong> — Percy's celestial bronze sword; appears as a pen to mortals.</li>
                <li><strong>Master Bolt</strong> — Zeus's weapon; its theft is the inciting incident of the first series.</li>
                <li><strong>Athena Parthenos</strong> — A symbol of Athena's wisdom and a powerful, world-shaping object in later books.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="mythology-section aspects">
            <h2>Greek vs Roman: Two Faces of the Gods</h2>
            <p>One of the series' most interesting ideas is that gods have dual aspects: Greek and Roman. The same deity can behave differently depending on which aspect is dominant — Athena vs. Minerva, Ares vs. Mars — and this split drives political and mystical conflict across the books. Camps, rituals, and even weapons can favor one aspect over the other.</p>
            <p>This duality isn't merely cosmetic. It reshapes how demigods experience destiny and community. Camp Half-Blood represents the Greek tradition: heroes, quests, and individual valor. Camp Jupiter represents Roman order: legions, duty, and sacrifice. Stories in the Heroes of Olympus series explore how these two cultures collide and eventually cooperate.</p>
            <p>Understanding the Greek/Roman split helps explain character motivations, alliances, and why some monsters or heroes react differently when confronted by a Roman versus a Greek demigod.</p>

        <section class="mythology-section resources">
            <h2>Further Reading & Resources</h2>
            <p>For readers who want to dig deeper, consult classical myths (Homer, Hesiod), modern retellings, and companion guides to the series. The world mixes canonical myth with new inventions — learning the original myths enriches the experience.</p>
            <p>If you'd like, I can add a small glossary, a bestiary page listing monsters with quotes and book references, or an artifacts index that links to where each item appears in the series.</p>
