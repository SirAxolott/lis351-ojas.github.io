		The Percy Jackson universe is a contemporary reimagining of classical myth where ancient Greek (and later Roman) deities, monsters, and magical rules exist alongside the modern world. In this setting, the Olympian gods never fully left Earth; they live hidden in familiar places (Mount Olympus is above the Empire State Building) and interact indirectly through prophecies, quests, and mortal agents. The gods’ children—demigods—are born when a god has a child with a mortal. These demigods possess inheritable abilities tied to their divine parent (e.g., control of water, cleverness, or martial skill) and often experience learning differences (presented as dyslexia/ADHD) as part of their mythically tuned brains.

		Central institutions include Camp Half-Blood (a safe haven and training ground for Greek demigods) and Camp Jupiter (its Roman counterpart), which highlight a recurring tension: Greek vs. Roman traditions and identities. The world’s antagonists range from mythic monsters and Titans to scheming gods and ancient prophecies that compel heroes toward difficult choices. Magic items—celestial bronze weapons, magical shields, and relics—play key roles, as do mythic creatures (satyrs, nymphs, cyclopes) that populate both danger and alliance.

	<p> 
		Narratively, the universe blends quest-driven adventures with coming-of-age themes: identity, chosen family, duty versus self, and the consequences of power. It expands into multiple series (Heroes of Olympus, Trials of Apollo) that deepen Roman-Greek dynamics and explore other corners of myth, making the PJ universe a modern, humorous, and emotionally grounded gateway to classical mythology for young readers and older fans alike.
